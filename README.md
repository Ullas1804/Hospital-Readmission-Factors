Predicting Hospital Readmission Factors in Diabetes Patients Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a diabetes dataset to identify key factors influencing hospital readmission rates. The analysis applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning to build a predictive model. The goal is to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions to reduce readmission rates and improve patient outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)
